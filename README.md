# ad-hoc sql-portfolio

Most of my work are on sensitive source code and analysis data, so I made this ad-hoc sql-portfolio over the weekend to showcase some of my capibilities.

1 and 2 are hard problems from [Leetcode's SQL50](https://leetcode.com/studyplan/top-sql-50/). I had completed most of them in the past and most of the time, SQL is not about code but logical thinking so I guess I will just showcase 2 of the more complex problem out of the 50.

3 is a simplified proof of concept (the original was based on very complex sensitive data, this one is based on Microsoft Open Source Data) I did to secure a consulting git. It showcase the use of dbt in transforming data.

Last but not least, the winning hackathon project that started my consulting career: [NFT Capsule](https://ethglobal.com/showcase/nft-capsule-onx8h).
